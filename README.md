# TravelJournal
Either one goes out with friends, has an unforgettable family excursion or round-the-world tour, one is always keen to keep a record of the people (s/he) interacts or the exposure (s/he) gets by visiting a place. Thatâ€™s where Travel Journal Application comes in. It responds as an impeccable knack for traveler by providing a diary where one can pen down the day-to-day activities during outing by capturing photos, postcards, flyers etc. and can jot down feelings about the sight so that (s/he) can relive the memories again and again. Tourist can also store the contact details of people (s/he) met, note the places (s/he) stayed, write down important information such as flight timings and insurance details and add recommended sights to visit for other users of the app. It is done by creating a master itinerary for each of trips attended by user with all travel details in one place. App would be designed as location based service by using Google Maps API where it can maintain a logbook, tracking the places visited by the users and delivering information about a device's physical location to another user or application, used in reference to mobile communication devices and cameras. Above all, one can access the app anytime, anywhere for free.
